    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">Nordson ASYMTEK Introduces Helios<sup>TM</sup> Automated Fluid Dispensing Platform for Medium and Bulk Volume Deposits</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | March 22, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Nordson ASYMTEK a Nordson company (NASDAQ: NDSN) and global leader in dispensing, jetting, and coating equipment and technologies, introduces the new Helios™ SD-960 Series Automated Dispensing System for medium and bulk volume deposits of single- (1K) and two-component (2K) materials in electronics manufacturing and printed circuit board assembly.<span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a><span class="is-hidden"> The Helios system is ideal to deposit volumes greater than 1cc, and line widths and dots that exceed 1mm, but it can deposit volumes down to 0.3cc and line widths as narrow as 0.3mm. The system supports highly abrasive thermal interface materials (TIM), silicones, epoxies, and grease for applications such as potting, sealing, gasketing, and structural adhesives.</span></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system was made specifically to accommodate large parts and substrates. The frame is 200mm taller and the robotics 150mm higher for more overhead clearance than a standard dispensing platform. An optional bulk fluid hose enclosure can provide added vertical clearance for securely routing remote bulk-feed hoses and to accommodate larger valves and mixers. There are two conveyor options, standard chain or double-wide chain. A large purge container holds volumes up to 2 liters.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system can be equipped with Nordson ASYMTEK dispense valves or Nordson 1k- or 2k-metering systems. When used with metering systems, the controls can be integrated so that the operator sees the metering system's monitor from the same position as the machine control. This allows the operator to focus on the dispensing area during operation.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system comes with Nordson ASYMTEK's Fluidmove® software, providing dispense programming control in a familiar Windows® environment. Closed-loop controls maintain unparalleled control and accuracy of the dispensing process. An optional needle sensor is available to monitor the positioning of large needles that deliver bulk amounts and a laser height sensor automatically calibrates for substrate height. A camera system enables programming and fiducial recognition, and an optional large-capacity, integrated weight scale provides Mass Flow Calibration to ensure that dispense volumes remain within defined process limits through weight-controlled dispensing and automatic calibration.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system accommodates a variety of bulk fluid supply options. Various size reservoirs, fluid regulators, booster pumps, level sensors, and more can be selected to fit the specific fluid and application requirements.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"The Helios SD-960 Series was developed by combining Nordson ASYMTEK's 30+ years' of expertise in micro-dispensing with the bulk and 2-component dispensing experience of other Nordson divisions," explained Almar Thewissen, product manager, Nordson ASYMTEK. "The result is a complete process solution for medium- to large-volume dispensing applications in electronics assembly."</p>

    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">Nordson DAGE announce the launch of Paragon<sup>TM</sup> Materials software</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | March 21, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Nordson DAGE, a division of Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ: NDSN), and the leading supplier of Bond Test and Materials Test equipment announces the launch of Paragon™ Materials, a new suite of software designed for performing mechanical failure analysis on a range of micro-materials.<span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">It is an exciting time to be in the micro-electronics industry as devices continue to become more complex and demands on their performance increase. Furthermore, expectations on product lifetime are as critical as ever, meaning new device evaluation needs to assess both long-term fatigue and cyclical performance. Adding to this complexity is the fact that failure can come from many different sources including individual interconnects, surface components, the substrate material, or a combination of several of these sources.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"Paragon<sup>TM</sup> Materials is specifically designed to tackle these complex failure modes and take the operator straight to the root cause of the failure mode. Traditionally, micro-materials testing has been difficult to set-up and even more taxing to extract the correct failure information from the raw data. Paragon™ Materials presents a clear interface to the user featuring built-in analysis tools and statistical algorithms – allowing the user to find every failure with ease.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Alan King, Business Director, Bond Test and Materials Test commented, “Paragon™ Materials is a software platform focused on the mechanical testing and data analysis of materials used in conjunction with the packaging of complex electrical devices. Bond testing typically evaluates the integrity of interconnect associated with die and integrated circuits, essentially their connection to the outside world however micro materials testing concentrates on evaluating the strength of the die and packaging itself."</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">This second level of functionality is especially applicable to researchers when qualifying new materials and quality assurance when new products go into production. "Paragon Materials software is a powerful addition to our already successful and established micro testing capability."</p>

    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">New Liquid GAP FILLER from Henkel Delivers Thermal Control, Automation and Reworkability</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 2 | March 28, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Irvine, CA -- Building on the leading BERGQUIST brand thermal management portfolio, Henkel has developed a brand new liquid GAP FILLER material that offers the rare advantage of thermal interface material (TIM) reworkability without sacrifices in thermal conductivity or automation performance. BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGF 1500RW delivers these three valuable benefits in a single material, extending even greater process flexibility and post-assembly adaptability.<span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Henkel’s new TIM is a one-part, cure-in-place liquid gap filler allowing use with automated dispensing equipment for high-volume manufacturing operations. Because the material is applied as a liquid, it is ideal for miniaturized, high-density assemblies and complex architectures, penetrating small gaps for complete coverage. Once cured, the material provides optimized surface contact and thermal transfer with a 1.5 W/m-K thermal conductivity, and also delivers excellent low and high temperature mechanical and chemical stability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"In addition to its high throughput and thermal control capabilities, what makes BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGF 1500RW distinctive among other liquid thermal interface materials is its peelability,” explains Doug Dixon, Henkel Adhesive Electronics Global Marketing Director. “Traditional cure-in-place TIMs generally require very high force for disassembly, which often results in permanent damage to components and substrates. The new BERGQUIST TIM, however, peels away cleanly from contact surfaces to safeguard delicate componentry and preserve product value."</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Supply chain simplification is another advantage of BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGF 1500RW. Notably, the material facilitates infinite thickness variations and accommodates multiple dimensions, allowing a single material to be used for many products and applications across the manufacturing operation. Conversely, TIMs in pad or film formats are supplied in pre-determined die cut shapes and thickness, with each requiring its own part number. Simplification of inventory complexity adds to cost-efficiency and optimized resource utilization.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"As today’s manufacturers must compete in demanding and dynamic environments where product performance, operational efficiency and profitability are equally prioritized,” says Dixon in summary, “materials like BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGR 1500RW that deliver thermal transfer performance, enable high volume production, streamline the supply chain and preserve assembly value help assembly specialists achieve their business objectives."</p>

    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">NEO Tech Introduces First Commercially Available Hands-Free MIC Assembly Line</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | Sunday, February 18th, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Today, the reliability of gallium nitride (GaN) device technology has improved significantly, making GaN a viable technology for both military and commercial applications. Consequently, integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers generally have migrated to GaN and other advanced semiconductor compounds to address next-generation, high-power output applications. In several military<span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a><span class="is-hidden"> radars, GaN-based devices have demonstrated five to ten times more power density than gallium arsenide (GaAs) or silicon power devices.</span></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">While designers can reduce the size of a device using GaN technology, it creates new complications. The more sophisticated the device, the thinner and more fragile the air-bridged die, the higher the number of I/Os, and the smaller the pitch between interconnects. These micro-miniature structures make it more difficult to assemble rapidly, accurately, consistently, and economically. Conventional methods of handling complex IC’s typically have been labor intensive, with unique process challenges in picking, placing, and wire bonding, leading to lower yields and reduced reliability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">To overcome these labor-intensive, process-dependent elements, NEO Tech has introduced its new generation of assembly automation, as well as more sophisticated levels of process characterization, enabling lower costs and enhanced reliability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech was one of the first US companies to bring commercially available, integrated automation to very thin and fragile semiconductor die, and the latest innovations are a significant extension of this achievement. For example, in existing manual or semi-automated lines, operators must subjectively judge the coverage under the die and visually estimate the permissible amount of material extruding from the edges, incurring the variability inherent in such methods. NEO Tech’s new “Auto Line” is dedicated to performing and measuring this task more accurately, consequently producing significant gains in repeatability, quality and reliability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">For GaN and similar advanced die or ICs, truly “hands-free” automation requires an accurate, high-resolution method for dispensing the precise amount of epoxy every time. The die-bonding platform must be constantly stable, regardless of fluctuations in temperature and humidity. NEO Tech’s unique machine configuration consistently achieves high-precision epoxy dispensing.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech partnered with leading precision assembly equipment manufacturer Palomar to develop and produce specialized die-attach systems using optically balanced breadboards, with internal dampening built into the honeycomb structure. The equipment’s resulting superior vibration dampening supports precision die attach at much higher speeds.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech’s achievements also include the ability to reliably handle large, thin, MMIC devices. Developments include extremely accurate dispense for epoxy and a proprietary die eutectic attach process, using solder preforms. These innovations enable manufacturing of MMICs with minimum voiding under dies as thin as 0.002 inches. Originally, NEO Tech developed this system to meet the needs of high-reliability applications in defense, advanced telecommunications, and implantable medical devices. System designers using large, thin, MMIC devices in their high-frequency applications now can work confidently with this option for both prototyping and manufacturing at scale.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The industry average for thin die damage in handling before placement into a higher level assembly exceeded 20 percent. For odd-shaped and extremely thin die and ICs, NEO Tech’s fully automatic eutectic die-attach process performs with consistently near-zero rework. In addition to practically eliminating damage and rework, NEO Tech’s continuous, contiguous auto line guarantees planar placement of these delicate die with minimal interface voids.  </p>
      <p class="is-hidden">For the notoriously sensitive eutectic die-attach method, the tuned handling and improved process accuracy represent significant breakthroughs in product quality, reliability, and cost.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Increasing overall process consistency by eliminating touch in areas such as epoxy dispense and eutectic attach was the critical first step. Gaining the full economic benefit, however, required integrating these and other advancements into an automated line capable of producing high-complexity devices at rates and yields supportive of today’s most demanding programs. NEO Tech has accomplished this with a level of quality and cost-efficiency exceeding existing MIC assembly touch methods.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">To further guarantee reliability and quality, thorough cleaning is mandatory to prevent latent defects in interface junctions during wire-bond interconnect. NEO Tech’s automated process includes in-line argon plasma cleaning just prior to wire or ribbon bonding, ensuring complete residual organic removal without exposing the IC to ion or UV.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech’s hands-free, continuous, contiguous, automatic MIC assembly lines operate in a lean manufacturing environment, with high repeatability and near-zero rework. High-frequency system designers seeking domestic suppliers offering the highest quality and the most cost-effective MIC solutions are encouraged to take advantage of these next-generation capabilities.</p>

    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | Tuesday, January 2, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Milpitas, California — The year-end update to the SEMI World Fab Forecast report reveals 2017 spending on fab equipment investments will reach an all-time high of $57 billion. High chip demand, strong pricing for memory, and fierce competition are driving the high-level of fab investments, with many companies investing at previously unseen levels for new fab construction and <span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a><span class="is-hidden">fab equipment.</span></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The SEMI World Fab Forecast data shows fab equipment spending in 2017 totaling US$57 billion, an increase of 41 percent year-over-year (YoY). In 2018, spending is expected to increase 11 percent to US$63 billion.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">While many companies, including Intel, Micron, Toshiba (and Western Digital), and GLOBALFOUNDRIES increased fab investments for 2017 and 2018, the strong increase reflects spending by just two companies and primarily one region.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">SEMI data shows a surge of investments in Korea, due primarily to Samsung, which is expected to increase its fab equipment spending by 128 percent in 2017, from US$8 billion to US$18 billion. SK Hynix also increased fab equipment spending, by about 70 percent, to US$5.5 billion, the largest spending level in its history. While the majority of Samsung and SK Hynix spending remains in Korea, some will take place in China and the United States. Both Samsung and SK Hynix are expected to maintain high levels of investments in 2018.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">In 2018, China is expected to begin equipping many fabs constructed in 2017. In the past, non-Chinese companies accounted for most fab investments in China. For the first time, in 2018 Chinese-owned device manufacturers will approach parity, spending nearly as much on fab equipment as their non-Chinese counterparts. In 2018, Chinese-owned companies are expected to invest about US$5.8 billion, while non-Chinese will invest US$6.7 billion. Many new companies such as Yangtze Memory Technology, Fujian Jin Hua, Hua Li, and Hefei Chang Xin Memory are investing heavily in the region. Historic highs in equipment spending in 2017 and 2018 reflect growing demand for advanced devices. This spending follows unprecedented growth in construction spending for new fabs also detailed in the SEMI World Fab Forecast report. Construction spending will reach all-time highs with China construction spending taking the lead at US$6 billion in 2017 and US$6.6 billion in 2018, establishing another record: no region has ever spent more than US$6 billion in a single year for construction.

Driving manufacturing efficiencies remains the overriding purpose of the FOA – where the “A” now stands for “Alliance.”  With FOA’s integration with SEMI, the association will leverage SEMI’s global infrastructure and connections to over 2,000 members around the world to extend its platforms for collaborative networking and benchmarking manufacturing operations<span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">“FOA members operate some of the most innovative and efficient fabrication facilities and are hotbeds for new optimization methodologies in integrated circuit and micro-electromechanical production,” said Ajit Manocha, president and CEO of SEMI. “The integration of FOA with SEMI brings together firsthand understanding of manufacturing challenges so we can help all SEMI members achieve higher operating efficiency.”</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">With integration complete, FOA is managed as a Special Interest Group (SIG) within SEMI. FOA member companies will become full SEMI members, with FOA continuing to expand its global membership through SEMI’s global network, while maintaining its unique community.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Established in 2004, FOA brings to SEMI a focus on addressing common semiconductor operations and manufacturing issues. The full integration comes after more than a year in which the organizations operated under an Association Management Agreement where SEMI provided FOA association services and deepened its association with FOA. SEMI-FOA will continue to focus on manufacturing efficiency, including the group’s popular benchmark activities, to enable best practices among FOA members. </p>
      <p class="is-hidden">“FOA members manufacture a wide variety of complex devices, many of which make up the applications we see in some of the most advanced automotive systems, medical devices, Smart Manufacturing and general IoT,” said Dale Miller, member of the FOA Executive Director, and Senior Director, Fab 9 Semiconductor Manufacturing Operations at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. “Given the strong growth in these applications, FOA members must keep the fabs humming at full capacity while always pursuing higher yield and lower cost. To help maintain this momentum, FOA will continue to enable members to collaborate on best practices and benchmarking while focusing on key issues such as cycle-time, yield and tool performance.”</p>

    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | February 1, 2018 </p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Concord, California, USA - Nordson MARCH, a Nordson company (NASDAQ: NDSN), a global leader in plasma processing technology, introduces the MesoSPHERE™ Plasma System for very-high throughput processing of 3D and wafer-level packaging processes such as fan-in, fan-out, wafer-level, and panel-level -handling wafers<span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a><span class="is-hidden">up to 450mm and panels up to 480mm. The MesoSPHERE's new, patented W3 three-axis symmetrical plasma chamber ensures that all areas of the wafer are treated equally and uniformly. Tight control over all process parameters gives highly repeatable results.</span></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">For wafer cleaning, the MesoSPHERE plasma system removes contamination prior to wafer bumping, organic contamination, fluorine and other halogen contamination, and metal and metal oxides. Plasma improves spun-on film adhesion and cleans metallic bond pads. </p>
      <p class="is-hidden">For wafer etching, the MesoSPHERE plasma system descums wafers of residual photoresist and BCB, pattern dielectric layers for redistribution, strip/etch photoresist, enhances adhesion of wafer applied materials, removes excess wafer applied mold /epoxy, enhances adhesion of gold solder bumps, destresses wafer to reduce breakage, improves spun-on film adhesion, and cleans aluminum bond pads.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The MesoSPHERE's chamber design and control architecture enable short plasma cycle times with very low overhead, maximizing throughput and minimizing cost of ownership. Plasma confinement technology uses a ring to isolate and focus plasma so it's distributed directly above the wafer, minimizing undesired secondary reactions. Process temperatures can be kept low because the ring increases etch rate capability without increasing the electrode temperature or adding bias to the chuck.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">An innovative handling system transfers round or square substrates and frame or bonded carriers. The modular design allows capacity increase on a per plasma chamber basis. Equipment front end module (EFEM) integration supports from 1 to 4 plasma chambers. A pocket chuck design provides accurate substrate placement and centering, for additional process repeatability. </p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"A unique feature of the MesoSPHERE is the way we developed the isolation," explained Jonathan Doan, director of marketing for Nordson MARCH. "It allows our customers a method to perform advanced packaging without having to use an expensive carrier and it can be used with 300mm wafers on frames."</p>
