    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 2 | March 22, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Nordson ASYMTEK a Nordson company (NASDAQ: NDSN) and global leader in dispensing, jetting, and coating equipment and technologies, introduces the new Helios™ SD-960 Series Automated Dispensing System for medium and bulk volume deposits of single- (1K) and two-component (2K) materials in electronics manufacturing and printed circuit board assembly.<span class="MainContent-ellipse">..</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a><span class="is-hidden"> The Helios system is ideal to deposit volumes greater than 1cc, and line widths and dots that exceed 1mm, but it can deposit volumes down to 0.3cc and line widths as narrow as 0.3mm. The system supports highly abrasive thermal interface materials (TIM), silicones, epoxies, and grease for applications such as potting, sealing, gasketing, and structural adhesives.</span></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system was made specifically to accommodate large parts and substrates. The frame is 200mm taller and the robotics 150mm higher for more overhead clearance than a standard dispensing platform. An optional bulk fluid hose enclosure can provide added vertical clearance for securely routing remote bulk-feed hoses and to accommodate larger valves and mixers. There are two conveyor options, standard chain or double-wide chain. A large purge container holds volumes up to 2 liters.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system can be equipped with Nordson ASYMTEK dispense valves or Nordson 1k- or 2k-metering systems. When used with metering systems, the controls can be integrated so that the operator sees the metering system's monitor from the same position as the machine control. This allows the operator to focus on the dispensing area during operation.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system comes with Nordson ASYMTEK's Fluidmove® software, providing dispense programming control in a familiar Windows® environment. Closed-loop controls maintain unparalleled control and accuracy of the dispensing process. An optional needle sensor is available to monitor the positioning of large needles that deliver bulk amounts and a laser height sensor automatically calibrates for substrate height. A camera system enables programming and fiducial recognition, and an optional large-capacity, integrated weight scale provides Mass Flow Calibration to ensure that dispense volumes remain within defined process limits through weight-controlled dispensing and automatic calibration.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The Helios system accommodates a variety of bulk fluid supply options. Various size reservoirs, fluid regulators, booster pumps, level sensors, and more can be selected to fit the specific fluid and application requirements.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"The Helios SD-960 Series was developed by combining Nordson ASYMTEK's 30+ years' of expertise in micro-dispensing with the bulk and 2-component dispensing experience of other Nordson divisions," explained Almar Thewissen, product manager, Nordson ASYMTEK. "The result is a complete process solution for medium- to large-volume dispensing applications in electronics assembly."</p>

    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">Nordson DAGE announce the launch of Paragon<sup>TM</sup> Materials software</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 2 | March 21, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Nordson DAGE, a division of Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ: NDSN), and the leading supplier of Bond Test and Materials Test equipment announces the launch of Paragon™ Materials, a new suite of software designed for performing mechanical failure analysis on a range of micro-materials.<span class="MainContent-ellipse">..</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">It is an exciting time to be in the micro-electronics industry as devices continue to become more complex and demands on their performance increase. Furthermore, expectations on product lifetime are as critical as ever, meaning new device evaluation needs to assess both long-term fatigue and cyclical performance. Adding to this complexity is the fact that failure can come from many different sources including individual interconnects, surface components, the substrate material, or a combination of several of these sources.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"Paragon<sup>TM</sup> Materials is specifically designed to tackle these complex failure modes and take the operator straight to the root cause of the failure mode. Traditionally, micro-materials testing has been difficult to set-up and even more taxing to extract the correct failure information from the raw data. Paragon™ Materials presents a clear interface to the user featuring built-in analysis tools and statistical algorithms – allowing the user to find every failure with ease.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Alan King, Business Director, Bond Test and Materials Test commented, “Paragon™ Materials is a software platform focused on the mechanical testing and data analysis of materials used in conjunction with the packaging of complex electrical devices. Bond testing typically evaluates the integrity of interconnect associated with die and integrated circuits, essentially their connection to the outside world however micro materials testing concentrates on evaluating the strength of the die and packaging itself."</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">This second level of functionality is especially applicable to researchers when qualifying new materials and quality assurance when new products go into production. "Paragon Materials software is a powerful addition to our already successful and established micro testing capability."</p>

    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">New Liquid GAP FILLER from Henkel Delivers Thermal Control, Automation and Reworkability</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 2 | March 28, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Irvine, CA -- Building on the leading BERGQUIST brand thermal management portfolio, Henkel has developed a brand new liquid GAP FILLER material that offers the rare advantage of thermal interface material (TIM) reworkability without sacrifices in thermal conductivity or automation performance. BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGF 1500RW delivers these three valuable benefits in a single material, extending even greater process flexibility and post-assembly adaptability.<span class="MainContent-ellipse">..</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Henkel’s new TIM is a one-part, cure-in-place liquid gap filler allowing use with automated dispensing equipment for high-volume manufacturing operations. Because the material is applied as a liquid, it is ideal for miniaturized, high-density assemblies and complex architectures, penetrating small gaps for complete coverage. Once cured, the material provides optimized surface contact and thermal transfer with a 1.5 W/m-K thermal conductivity, and also delivers excellent low and high temperature mechanical and chemical stability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"In addition to its high throughput and thermal control capabilities, what makes BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGF 1500RW distinctive among other liquid thermal interface materials is its peelability,” explains Doug Dixon, Henkel Adhesive Electronics Global Marketing Director. “Traditional cure-in-place TIMs generally require very high force for disassembly, which often results in permanent damage to components and substrates. The new BERGQUIST TIM, however, peels away cleanly from contact surfaces to safeguard delicate componentry and preserve product value."</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Supply chain simplification is another advantage of BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGF 1500RW. Notably, the material facilitates infinite thickness variations and accommodates multiple dimensions, allowing a single material to be used for many products and applications across the manufacturing operation. Conversely, TIMs in pad or film formats are supplied in pre-determined die cut shapes and thickness, with each requiring its own part number. Simplification of inventory complexity adds to cost-efficiency and optimized resource utilization.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">"As today’s manufacturers must compete in demanding and dynamic environments where product performance, operational efficiency and profitability are equally prioritized,” says Dixon in summary, “materials like BERGQUIST GAP FILLER TGR 1500RW that deliver thermal transfer performance, enable high volume production, streamline the supply chain and preserve assembly value help assembly specialists achieve their business objectives."</p>
