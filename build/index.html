    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">NEO Tech Introduces First Commercially Available Hands-Free MIC Assembly Line</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | Sunday, February 18th, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Today, the reliability of gallium nitride (GaN) device technology has improved significantly, making GaN a viable technology for both military and commercial applications. Consequently, integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers generally have migrated to GaN and other advanced semiconductor compounds to address next-generation, high-power output applications. In several military<span class="MainContent-ellipse">...</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a><span class="is-hidden"> radars, GaN-based devices have demonstrated five to ten times more power density than gallium arsenide (GaAs) or silicon power devices.</span></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">While designers can reduce the size of a device using GaN technology, it creates new complications. The more sophisticated the device, the thinner and more fragile the air-bridged die, the higher the number of I/Os, and the smaller the pitch between interconnects. These micro-miniature structures make it more difficult to assemble rapidly, accurately, consistently, and economically. Conventional methods of handling complex IC’s typically have been labor intensive, with unique process challenges in picking, placing, and wire bonding, leading to lower yields and reduced reliability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">To overcome these labor-intensive, process-dependent elements, NEO Tech has introduced its new generation of assembly automation, as well as more sophisticated levels of process characterization, enabling lower costs and enhanced reliability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech was one of the first US companies to bring commercially available, integrated automation to very thin and fragile semiconductor die, and the latest innovations are a significant extension of this achievement. For example, in existing manual or semi-automated lines, operators must subjectively judge the coverage under the die and visually estimate the permissible amount of material extruding from the edges, incurring the variability inherent in such methods. NEO Tech’s new “Auto Line” is dedicated to performing and measuring this task more accurately, consequently producing significant gains in repeatability, quality and reliability.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">For GaN and similar advanced die or ICs, truly “hands-free” automation requires an accurate, high-resolution method for dispensing the precise amount of epoxy every time. The die-bonding platform must be constantly stable, regardless of fluctuations in temperature and humidity. NEO Tech’s unique machine configuration consistently achieves high-precision epoxy dispensing.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech partnered with leading precision assembly equipment manufacturer Palomar to develop and produce specialized die-attach systems using optically balanced breadboards, with internal dampening built into the honeycomb structure. The equipment’s resulting superior vibration dampening supports precision die attach at much higher speeds.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech’s achievements also include the ability to reliably handle large, thin, MMIC devices. Developments include extremely accurate dispense for epoxy and a proprietary die eutectic attach process, using solder preforms. These innovations enable manufacturing of MMICs with minimum voiding under dies as thin as 0.002 inches. Originally, NEO Tech developed this system to meet the needs of high-reliability applications in defense, advanced telecommunications, and implantable medical devices. System designers using large, thin, MMIC devices in their high-frequency applications now can work confidently with this option for both prototyping and manufacturing at scale.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The industry average for thin die damage in handling before placement into a higher level assembly exceeded 20 percent. For odd-shaped and extremely thin die and ICs, NEO Tech’s fully automatic eutectic die-attach process performs with consistently near-zero rework. In addition to practically eliminating damage and rework, NEO Tech’s continuous, contiguous auto line guarantees planar placement of these delicate die with minimal interface voids.  </p>
      <p class="is-hidden">For the notoriously sensitive eutectic die-attach method, the tuned handling and improved process accuracy represent significant breakthroughs in product quality, reliability, and cost.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Increasing overall process consistency by eliminating touch in areas such as epoxy dispense and eutectic attach was the critical first step. Gaining the full economic benefit, however, required integrating these and other advancements into an automated line capable of producing high-complexity devices at rates and yields supportive of today’s most demanding programs. NEO Tech has accomplished this with a level of quality and cost-efficiency exceeding existing MIC assembly touch methods.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">To further guarantee reliability and quality, thorough cleaning is mandatory to prevent latent defects in interface junctions during wire-bond interconnect. NEO Tech’s automated process includes in-line argon plasma cleaning just prior to wire or ribbon bonding, ensuring complete residual organic removal without exposing the IC to ion or UV.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">NEO Tech’s hands-free, continuous, contiguous, automatic MIC assembly lines operate in a lean manufacturing environment, with high repeatability and near-zero rework. High-frequency system designers seeking domestic suppliers offering the highest quality and the most cost-effective MIC solutions are encouraged to take advantage of these next-generation capabilities.</p>

    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">SEMI Data Projects New Highs in Fab Equipment Spending</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | Tuesday, January 2, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Milpitas, California — The year-end update to the SEMI World Fab Forecast report reveals 2017 spending on fab equipment investments will reach an all-time high of $57 billion. High chip demand, strong pricing for memory, and fierce competition are driving the high-level of fab investments, with many companies investing at previously unseen levels for new fab construction and fab equipment. <span class="MainContent-ellipse">..</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">The SEMI World Fab Forecast data shows fab equipment spending in 2017 totaling US$57 billion, an increase of 41 percent year-over-year (YoY). In 2018, spending is expected to increase 11 percent to US$63 billion.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">While many companies, including Intel, Micron, Toshiba (and Western Digital), and GLOBALFOUNDRIES increased fab investments for 2017 and 2018, the strong increase reflects spending by just two companies and primarily one region.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">SEMI data shows a surge of investments in Korea, due primarily to Samsung, which is expected to increase its fab equipment spending by 128 percent in 2017, from US$8 billion to US$18 billion. SK Hynix also increased fab equipment spending, by about 70 percent, to US$5.5 billion, the largest spending level in its history. While the majority of Samsung and SK Hynix spending remains in Korea, some will take place in China and the United States. Both Samsung and SK Hynix are expected to maintain high levels of investments in 2018.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">In 2018, China is expected to begin equipping many fabs constructed in 2017. In the past, non-Chinese companies accounted for most fab investments in China. For the first time, in 2018 Chinese-owned device manufacturers will approach parity, spending nearly as much on fab equipment as their non-Chinese counterparts. In 2018, Chinese-owned companies are expected to invest about US$5.8 billion, while non-Chinese will invest US$6.7 billion. Many new companies such as Yangtze Memory Technology, Fujian Jin Hua, Hua Li, and Hefei Chang Xin Memory are investing heavily in the region. Historic highs in equipment spending in 2017 and 2018 reflect growing demand for advanced devices. This spending follows unprecedented growth in construction spending for new fabs also detailed in the SEMI World Fab Forecast report. Construction spending will reach all-time highs with China construction spending taking the lead at US$6 billion in 2017 and US$6.6 billion in 2018, establishing another record: no region has ever spent more than US$6 billion in a single year for construction.

    <h2 class="Heading-secondary">SEMI and Fab Owners Association Strengthen Supply Chain</h2>
    <p class="MainContent-date">Issue 1 | Monday, January 8, 2018</p>
    <div> 
      <p class="MainContent-copy">Milpitas, California — After several years of close partnership, SEMI and the Fab Owners Association (FOA) have fully integrated. Driving manufacturing efficiencies remains the overriding purpose of the FOA – where the “A” now stands for “Alliance.”  With FOA’s integration with SEMI, the association will leverage SEMI’s global infrastructure and connections to over 2,000 members around the world to extend its platforms for collaborative networking and benchmarking manufacturing operations.<span class="MainContent-ellipse">..</span><a class="MainContent-more">read more</a></p>
      <p class="is-hidden">“FOA members operate some of the most innovative and efficient fabrication facilities and are hotbeds for new optimization methodologies in integrated circuit and micro-electromechanical production,” said Ajit Manocha, president and CEO of SEMI. “The integration of FOA with SEMI brings together firsthand understanding of manufacturing challenges so we can help all SEMI members achieve higher operating efficiency.”</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">With integration complete, FOA is managed as a Special Interest Group (SIG) within SEMI. FOA member companies will become full SEMI members, with FOA continuing to expand its global membership through SEMI’s global network, while maintaining its unique community.</p>
      <p class="is-hidden">Established in 2004, FOA brings to SEMI a focus on addressing common semiconductor operations and manufacturing issues. The full integration comes after more than a year in which the organizations operated under an Association Management Agreement where SEMI provided FOA association services and deepened its association with FOA. SEMI-FOA will continue to focus on manufacturing efficiency, including the group’s popular benchmark activities, to enable best practices among FOA members. </p>
      <p class="is-hidden">“FOA members manufacture a wide variety of complex devices, many of which make up the applications we see in some of the most advanced automotive systems, medical devices, Smart Manufacturing and general IoT,” said Dale Miller, member of the FOA Executive Director, and Senior Director, Fab 9 Semiconductor Manufacturing Operations at GLOBALFOUNDRIES. “Given the strong growth in these applications, FOA members must keep the fabs humming at full capacity while always pursuing higher yield and lower cost. To help maintain this momentum, FOA will continue to enable members to collaborate on best practices and benchmarking while focusing on key issues such as cycle-time, yield and tool performance.”</p>
